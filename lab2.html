		<h2 align="center">'I was just laughing' - Grealish reveals reaction to another brace from 'not human' Haaland</h2>
		<p>It is getting to a stage where there are no words left to describe Erling Haaland and even his teammates just have to laugh when he inevitably scores.

		<b><i>WHAT HE SAID</i></b>: "It's unbelievable honestly. I've never witnessed anything like it in my life," the England winger told <b><i>BT Sport</i></b>. "For the first and second goals I was just laughing. He is always there. The keeper said something to me as I was walking back. He said 'he's not human!' I said 'you're telling me?' Hopefully he can carry on this form and take us to glory."</p>

	<h2 align="center">Premier League top scorers 2022/23: Is Erling Haaland set to beat the all-time season record?</h2>
	<p>With his hat trick against Manchester United at the start of October, Haaland took his tally up to 14 goals in his debut Premier League season. He's only played eight games so far.</p>
	<p>If we view his goalscoring in purely mathematical terms, the Norwegian is set to smash both the 42 and 38-game records. He currently averages 1.75 goals a game - if that rate is kept up, the 22-year-old will end the season with around 66 league strikes, comfortably beating the records held by Shearer, Cole and Salah.At this rate, he would pass Salah's haul by late January and take the official record jointly held by Cole and Shearer in early February.</p>
	<p>Manager Pep Guardiola has previously been chastised by members of the FPL community for his 'Pep roulette' routine - frequently swapping attackers in and out of his starting XI. That seems unlikely to be the case for Haaland, even when rotation happens naturally throughout the season, because of the unique and overpowering influence on their attack he has shown so far.</p>
	<p>Haaland has enjoyed an incredible start and has already taken a huge chunk out of the goals he needs to break the record. Unless he's chopped down with an injury that keeps him out for a few months, it's Haaland's record to take.</p>
